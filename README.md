# Object detection using Yolo in Image, video, and webcam.

This is to detect objects in a video or by use of webcam using OpenCV, Yolo, and python 

This is a program to detect objects in a video using YOLO algorithm 
This program is for object detection using YOLO.

Yolo is a deep learning algorithm that came out in May 2016 and it became quickly so popular because it’s so fast compared with the previous deep learning algorithm.

Opencv: also OpenCV has a deep learning framework that works with YOLO. Just make sure you have OpenCV 3.4.2 at least.

Advantage: it works without needing to install anything except OpenCV.

Disadvantage: it only works with CPU, so you can’t get really high speed to process videos in real-time

# Developing Environment 

## Python 

For downloading python just go to https://www.python.org/ and click download click or you can use this link this will download the latest version of python for you https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.2/python-3.8.2.exe

after that a .exe file will be downloaded just go through it and "eureka" you Python is installed

## OpenCV 

to install OpenCV just write the following commands in the cmd 

run pip install opencv-python if you need only main modules.
run pip install opencv-contrib-python if you need both main and contrib modules 

(check extra modules listing from OpenCV documentation at https://docs.opencv.org/master/ )

You can also refer to this video link on how to install OpenCV in below given IDE's

#note:-

# To download yolov3.weights go the drive link below 

also if you want to use just webcam replce test.mp4 with 0
// fourcc = cv2.VideoWriter_fourcc(*"XVID")
// out = cv2.VideoWriter("the_new_video_is.avi", fourcc , 25, (852, 480))

# Output
sample output can be found here
